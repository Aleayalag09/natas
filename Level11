Very complicated encripting problem solved following this steps
Take the cookie that the website gave to you
Create a cycle in which you apply xor encryption between the cookie value b64decoded and this {"showpassword":"no","bgcolor":"#ffffff"}
The output is going to reveal a patern which is the key of the origianl xor encrypted funciton
Then you have to create an array( "showpassword"=>"yes", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff") and apply json_decode, xor_encrypt (with the key of the previos step), base64_encode
This new value will be the cookie that you have to put in the browser and then when you reload the page there is the password of the next level
